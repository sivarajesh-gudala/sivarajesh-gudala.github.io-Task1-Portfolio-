                The main aim is to design multi band micro strip square patch antenna loaded with new DGS consisting
                of spiral shape and semi arc ground plane has been presented to operate in multiple frequencies. It
                is easy in Fabrication. Radiation patterns are Omni-directional. This antenna is highly suitable for
                S, C, X and Ka band Applications. It can be used for WLAN, WI-MAX, WLL and other wireless
                applications.

                PHP to
                name a few. A Web developer is usually concerned with the back end or the programming aspect of
                creating
                a website or Web application and is not to be confused with a Web designer, who only deals with the

                write it all by yourself. Libraries typically also go through the trouble to make sure the code is
                efficient and works well across browsers and devices (not always the case, but typically they do).
            </p>
            <a href="https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html"><u>ReactJs</u></a>
